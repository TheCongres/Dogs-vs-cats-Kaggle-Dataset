# Dogs-vs-cats-Kaggle-Dataset
A CNN-based deep learning model from ImageNet was utilized to extract image features. These were stored in a CSV file. Using these features, an SVM model was trained on 70% of the data to classify cat and dog images, then tested on the remaining 30%.

We used a DL model based on CNN which is preformed on ImageNet (taken from the site
 https://keras.io/api/applications/) to extract the characteristics of the images (feature
 Extract) and store these vectors in a CSV file.
 â€¢ using the extracted characteristics (the CSV file), form (Train) an SVM model for
